Description:
  - This code refactoring homework was to essentially clean up an example website page's code in both HTML and CSS, so it's more 
    presentable and accessible to look at for others (people looking at your code/employers/etc).
  - It works because the links in the navbar properly directs the person to the specific section within that page, and there are 
    semantic HTML tags that are not only organization purposes, but for website search optimization. In CSS, the code is more structured 
    and efficient to look at because the multiple ID's that had the same properties and values, were grouped up together in a same class. 
    
Technologies:
  - Visual Studio Code
  - HTML, CSS
  
Challenges:
  - It was a simple and fun experience to be able to clean up code because I'm generally a clean and organized person! 
  - I didn't face any difficulty at all when doing the actual code refactoring since I took my time and put a lot of thought into the
    steps to tackle each problem. The only 'difficult' time I had was that there was a minor problem with the GitHub Pages link, where
    one of the images never appeared, even though it looked perfectly fine when I Alt + B'd in VS Code. I went to office hours, and
    there was nothing wrong with my code, so it was somehow only on my end since the website through GitHub pages looked fine in other
    people's screens.
  - I learned the different semantic HTML tags that I will definitely use in the future, and I learned code refactoring in an efficient
    way overall!
